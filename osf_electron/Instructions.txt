How To Use The Facebook Scraper

1. Install Docker
- in your web browser, visit https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
- download Docker
- double click the .dmg and follow the installation instructions
- note, you do not need to sign into Docker after it's installed

2. Right click FacebookScraper.app and click open (this is necessary because I am an unidentified developer).
- you may need to enable applications from unidentified developers
System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow apps from unidentified developers

3. Enter your facebook username and password and then click "Generate PDF", leave your computer plugged in and connected to the internet over night, in the morning a PDF will be on your desktop with your friends Facebook statuses from the week after November 8, 2016.

To protect your privacy, this program runs locally on your laptop, your username and password are only sent to Facebook.
