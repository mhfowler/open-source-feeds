How To Use The Facebook Scraper

1. Install Docker
- in your web browser, visit https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
- download Docker
- double click the .dmg and follow the installation instructions
- note, you do not need to sign into Docker after it's installed

2. Right click Open Source Feeds.app and click open (this is necessary because I am an unidentified developer).
- you may need to enable applications from unidentified developers
System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow apps from unidentified developers

The application will take 5 to 10 minutes to start up the first time as it starts the Docker containers it needs to run.

3. Scrape your friends
- Within the app, click Facebook, then click Friends
- Enter your facebook username and password and then click "Fetch Friends"
- It usually takes about 10 minutes, after it's finished, there will be a file in ~/Desktop/osf/data/friends/current.json with a list of your Facebook friends.

4. Scrape posts
- Within the app, click Facebook, then click Posts
- Enter an After Date as far back as you like (I'd recommend doing a month or two)
- Leave Before Date blank (to get posts up to the present)
- Leave the "download images" checkbox unclicked (image links will work fine for the workshop tomorrow).
- Enter your facebook username and password and then click "Fetch Posts"
- Depending on how far back you set the After Date, and how many friends you have, it will effect how long the scraping takes.
With good wifi, downloading 1200 of my friend's posts over the past year, the scraper took about 6 hours to finish (I'd recommend
plugging your computer in and letting it run overnight).
- As the scraper goes, it will put .json files into a folder in ~/Desktop/osf/posts
--> tomorrow we will use the .json as source data to print out your posts and make our own feeds.
